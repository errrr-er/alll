  "JP:卜占\fCN:占卜法\n消耗：4点魔法值；1D2点理智值\n施法用时：5+分钟\n法术揭示未来的预兆——要施法者有足够悟性才能理解。占卜的工具有很多种，比如占卜镜、塔罗牌、动物内脏、茶叶、符文，或者飞鸟的排列次序，任何一种都可以。是否理解占卜的预兆，需要一次检定，结果在占卜者的POW以下方为成功。这预兆可能是模糊的、微妙的、梦幻的或隐晦的诗句——未来不是印在书上的白纸黑字，而是印在施法者头脑当中的信息或印象。使用该魔法成功后，调查员至少能获得一项有效信息。备注：KP需要仔细准备预兆。泄露太多会让玩家失去自由意志的感觉，也会束缚KP行动的自由。泄露太少则没有意义，令人沮丧。仔细衡量过的预兆，可以在KP展现似乎和预兆有关的后续事件时有意义地增加紧张感和战栗感。\n别名：卜卦法、预兆法、卢恩占卜、命运之眼\fEN:AUGURY/Augury\nCost: 4 magic points; 1D2 Sanity points\nCasting time: 5+ minutes\nCasting grants portents of the future—if the caster is enlightened enough to understand them. The tools for scrying vary and could be anything from using a scrying mirror to tarot cards, animal entrails to tealeaves, the casting of runes or watching the flight patterns of birds. Timing can vary due to the tools and nature of the scrying.The chance of understanding an augury is a roll equal to or less than the augur’s POW. A portent may be vague, subtle, dreamlike, or in a cryptic verse—the future is not a book to be read, but rather a message or impression upon the caster’s mind. Successful use of the spell should provide at least one useful piece of information.\nNote: the Keeper should prepare the portent with care. Revealing too much can easily rob players of their sense of free will and can limit the Keeper’s freedom of action. Revealing too little is pointless and frustrating. A well-balanced portent can add meaningful thrills and chills to the game when the Keeper stages future events which seem to correlate with the portent.\nAlternative names: Augur, Scry, Cast the Runes, The Eye of Destiny."
