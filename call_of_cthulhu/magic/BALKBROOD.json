  "JP:雛を取り除く\fCN:幼体驱除术\n消耗：可变的魔法值；1D3点理智值\n施法用时：3轮\n从目标身上召唤出艾霍特的幼体。施法者（和其他了解本法术的人）可以消耗任意多魔法值。吟唱咒语时接触施法者的人可以贡献1点魔法值，但每个参与者的理智损失都是1D3点。施法者将仪式中投入的累计魔法值乘以五，并在与KP的对抗检定中以这个值为基准——KP则将艾霍特植入幼体后经过的天数乘以五，作为检定的基准值。若施法者胜出，则寄生在目标身上的幼体将从目标的孔窍当中倾巢而出，这个过程损失1D4点理智值。并且目标每被幼体寄生一天，他还要损失1点耐久值。寄生可能已经对目标造成了巨大的伤害，但是外表掩盖了明显的症状。移除幼体可能导致目标死亡，但不管怎样，假使寄生持续发展，他们的命运也是注定的。每次施放本法术，参与者都会冒艾霍特出现的风险；第一次施放时是10%，此后每次施放都会增加10%的几率。艾霍特会首先攻击施法者，毁灭那些和自己的幼体作对的人。\n别名：驱散迷宫之子、打破白死之卵\fEN:BALKBROOD/BalkBrood\nCost: variable magic points; 1D3 Sanity points\nCasting time: 3 rounds\nCalls forth the brood of Eihort from a target. The caster (and others who know the spell) can expend as many magic points as desired. Those who touch the caster while the spell is intoned may add +1 magic point per person, though the Sanity cost remains at 1D3 points for each person involved. The caster multiplies the number of magic points invested in the ritual by five and attempts to roll under this number on 1D100 in an opposed roll against the Keeper—the Keeper multiplies the number of days elapsed since the injection of the brood of Eihort by five, and attempts to roll under this value in the contest. If the caster is successful, the brood infesting the target promptly cascade out of his or herorifices, costing 1D4 Sanity points in the process. The target also loses 1 hit point for each day they have been infested by the brood. The infestation may already have caused the target great harm, which their presence keeps from being obvious. Removing the brood may kill the target, but they are doomed anyway should the infestation take its natural course. At each casting of this spell the participants risk the appearance of Eihort; beginning at 10%, but rising by +10% each time the spell is cast thereafter. Eihort will attack the caster first, acting to destroy those who oppose its brood.\nAlternative names: Dispel Children of the Labyrinth, Crack the Eggs of White Death."
