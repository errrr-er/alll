  "JP:狂気の笛\n聞くものを狂気にする笛。\fCN:疯狂之笛\n消耗：5点魔法值；1D6点理智值\n施法用时：5轮\n听到本法术的人有疯狂的危险。本法术必须用“诅咒之笛创建术”创建的附魔骨笛施放。施法者用笛子演奏一段特殊的奇怪旋律，然后牺牲法术必要的消耗。所有能听到奇怪旋律的人必须进行理智检定；若失败，听者立即失去5点理智值并疯狂发作（听者陷入临时性疯狂）；若理智检定成功，听者失去1D3点理智值（一般不会疯狂）。笛子演奏时，每听到5轮笛声，听者就要做一次理智检定（损失累计）。如果笛子的演奏者还有理智值可以失去，他们可能需要在演奏的前五轮结束时进行一次理智检定（KP裁定）。如果此检定失败，演奏者将临时疯狂（失去5点理智值）并只要有可能就不停地演奏这异界的旋律。听者如果能成功抵抗旋律的效果，也可以尝试阻止演奏的继续。\n别名：天堂的黑暗之歌、深渊之旋律、七重地狱的合奏\fEN:PIPESOFMADNESS/PipesofMadness\nCost: 5 magic points; 1D6 Sanity points\nCasting time: 5 rounds\nThose hearing this spell risk insanity. The spell must be cast with the enchanted bone pipe created by the spell Create Curse Whistle (page 86). The caster plays a specific weird melody on the pipes and sacrifices the necessary costs. All within earshot of the strange melody should make a Sanity roll: failure causes the loss of 5 Sanity points and an immediate bout of madness (the listener going temporarily insane); if the Sanity roll is successful, the listener loses 1D3 Sanity points (and ordinarily does not go insane). Listeners should make a Sanity roll for every 5 rounds that the pipes are played and heard (losses being cumulative). Should the player of the pipes have Sanity to lose, they may be asked to also make a single Sanity roll at the end of the first five rounds of playing (at the Keeper’s discretion). If such a roll is failed, the player goes temporarily insane (losing 5 Sanity points) and becomes locked into playing the otherworldly tune for as long as possible. Listeners may attempt to prevent further playing if they can successfully resist the melody’s effect.\nAlternate names: The Dark Song of the Heavens, Ye Abyssal Melody, Harmony of the Seven Hells."
