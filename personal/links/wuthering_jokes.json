  "#1\nN：Guys, is lumi worth the corals if i have no yinlin ?\n3：no\n3：and lumi doesn’t even replace yinlin anywhere, its a false comparison\nN：She’s that bad?\n3：a 4* isn’t worth 80 corals\n_：you will get her somethings when you are pulling for other characters\nN：Well, you guys are right in hindsight",
  "#2\nK：i regret not playing SK was live 😦\nT：she's prob rerunning in 2.1 or 2.2 so nothing to worry , this isn't genshin to have a character jailed for 2 f#cking years\n(按理来说其实这算原*笑话但是发生在鸣潮讨论里所以放进来了)",
  "#3\nB：so what's the point of having elemental dmg? does it do more dmg to shields? or something? or is it exactly the same as base dmg\n3：dunno, blame kuro\n(前情提要他们在讨论元素伤害和抵抗)",
  "#4\nW：Do Zhezhi and Yinlin have a good early sequence? I'm thinking to vertical investment on rectifier waifu\n3：unsure about zhezhi but yinlin’s s1 isn’t notable and her s2 is a speed bonus\nW：in that case I'll go Zhezhi then because I like glasses more. thanks for the input also about most S1 not big\n3：valid reasoning, always go for waifu over meta\n(前情提要他们在讨论命座)"
