  "JP:魚を引きつける\fCN:诱鱼术\n消耗：4点魔法值\n施法用时：5分钟\n召唤鱼类聚集到施法者的位置。施法者必须准备鱼饵（掺入施法者的血液），并将它投入大海（或者开放水域），同时吟唱咒语。1小时之内，将有1D100条本地鱼种的鱼聚集过来。深层魔法：深潜者知道本法术的一个变体，会把它传授给他们觉得值得关注的人。此变体不需要血饵，但需要一枚深潜者制造的护身符，把它扔进海里，同时吟唱达贡的颂歌。有些人说护身符不只会吸引鱼类，还会吸引到一些不那么安全的东西。\n别名：集取大海的丰饶\fEN:ATTRACTFISH/AttractFish\nCost: 4 magic points\nCasting time: 5 minutes\nSummons fish to the caster’s location. The caster must prepare bait (mixed with the caster’s blood), which is then thrown into the ocean (or open water location) while a chant is sung. Within 1 hour 1D100 fish, local to the area, congregate. \nDeeper magic: a variation of this spell is known by the deep ones, who may impart it to those worthy of their attention. The variation does not require blood-bait, but rather a talisman, crafted by the deep ones, which is thrown into the ocean as a chant to Dagon is sung. Some say the talisman doesn’t only attract fish, but also other less wholesome things.\nAlternative names: Gather the Abundance of the Sea."
