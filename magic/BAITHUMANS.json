  "JP:人間をおびき寄せる\fCN:人类引诱术\n消耗：1点魔法值\n施法用时：1轮\n目标的眼前会出现一块大得难以置信、做工精良的钻石幻象（只有目标自己能看见）。目标如果走近幻象，它会以大致相同的速度后退，方向由施法者自由决定，想必会引到饥饿的钻地魔虫等候的地方。和垂钓一样，目标是愿者上钩。据信只有钻地魔虫知道本法术，另外还有一个变体叫做“潜沙怪引诱术”，漂浮的钻石形象换成了鲜嫩滴血的人类腰腿肉。但是，零星有典籍暗示有些狂热于力量的巫师已经成功改编了这个法术来自己使用。本法术持续五分钟并可以任意次反复施放（每次支付1点魔法值）。法术范围大约1英里。深层魔法：线索表明本法术存在一些只有最古老最强大的巫师才懂得的变体。在这些罕见的变体中，目标会看见他心中的渴望，不论它是金钱、失去的爱人还是其他的东西。这个版本的法术恐怕任何典籍都找不到，只能存在于不死巫师疯狂的脑海里。如果找到了这种法术，那肯定是要支付理智值的。\n别名：进食仪式、引诱弱者、欲望宝石\fEN:BAITHUMANS/BaitHumans\nCost: 1 magic point\nCasting time: 1 round\nAn illusion (visible only to the target) of a fabulously large and beautifully cut diamond floats in the air before the target’s eyes. As the target approaches the illusion, the object recedes at approximately the same speed, in the direction the caster wills, presumably to where a hungry chthonian waits. As in sport fishing, the target decides whether to take the bait. It is thought that only chthonians know this spell, as a variation exists called Bait Sand Dwellers, which exchanges the image of a floating diamond for that of a tender human haunch, dripping fresh blood. However, one or two tomes suggest that some power-crazed sorcerers may have succeeded in transcribing this spell for their own use. The spell lasts for five minutes and can be repeated indefinitely (paying 1 magic point per use). Approximate range of the spell is one mile. \nDeeper magic: it is hinted that an alternative version of the spell exists, known only to the most powerful and ancient of wizards. In this rare version, the target is enchanted to see his or her heart’s desire, be it gold, a lost love one, or something else. It is unlikely this version of the spell could be found written in any tomes, existing only within the insane minds of deathless sorcerers. If such a spell were to be found, there would certainly be a Sanity cost to pay.\nAlternative names: The Rite of Feeding, Allure of the Weak, Jewel of Desire."
